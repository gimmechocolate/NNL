Networked Player Lasers Mod for PAYDAY 2

Most of this mod is fairly self explanatory, but in-depth explanations can be found in this readme.

New Networked Lasers, by popular consensus also known as "NNL," "New Networked Lasers," "Networked Player Lasers Mod," and "Would You Stop Asking Me What To Name Your Stupid Mod, Get Out Of My Face Already, Weirdo," is a BLT (Lua) mod for the video game PAYDAY 2, also known as "ACCESS VIOLATION SIMULATOR."


This mod is designed to let you change the color of your weapon laser attachments from the normal green. 
Unlike other mods on the market, it also lets you sync this color with any other clients who have this mod.
Also unlike other mods on the market, the mod lets you create your own flashing color patterns (referred to henceforth as "gradients") as one would with a fancy RGB keyboard/mouse.

The in-game mod options are largely self-explanatory, but if you're reading this they're obviously not self-explanatory enough.
OH, LET'S BREAK IT DOWN!

[] Master Enable Gradients: (Checkbox)
This option is a master control that enables gradients for the entire mod. Disabling this will stop any gradiented lasers from being rendered, and instead will only use solid single colors, regardless of other "Enable [x] Gradient Lasers" checkboxes.

[] Enable My Gradient Lasers: (Checkbox)
This option enables gradients for your weapons. Disabling this will only prevent your weapons from using gradient lasers, and will instead only use solid single colors. As long as you have Master Enable Gradients enabled, other entities' laser colors will not be affected by this option.

[] Enable Team Gradient Lasers: (Checkbox)
This option enables gradients for your teammates' weapons. Disabling this will only prevent their weapons from using gradient lasers, and will instead only use solid single colors. As long as you have Master Enable Gradients enabled, other, non-teammate entities' laser colors, including but not limited to your own and snipers' lasers, will not be affected by this option.

[] Enable Sniper Gradient Lasers: (Checkbox)
You should know the drill by now.

[] Enable World Gradient Lasers: (Checkbox)
Seriously. It's pretty obvious.

[]Enable Turret Gradient Lasers: (Checkbox)
I'm not sure what else to say.

[]Red/Green/Blue/Alpha:
